<p>One of the foundational aspects of statistical analysis is inference, or the process of drawing conclusions about a larger population from a sample of data. Although counter intuitive, the standard practice is to attempt to disprove a research claim that is not of interest. For example, to show that one medical treatment is better than another, we can assume that the two treatments lead to equal survival rates only to then be disproved by the data. Additionally, we introduce the idea of a p-value, or the degree of disagreement between the data and the hypothesis. We also dive into confidence intervals, which measure the magnitude of the effect of interest (e.g. how much better one treatment is than another).</p>

<h2>1- Introduction to ideas of inference</h2>
<p>In this chapter, you will investigate how repeated samples taken from a population can vary. It is the variability in samples that allow you to make claims about the population of interest. It is important to remember that the research claims of interest focus on the population while the information available comes only from the sample data.</p>

<h2>1-5 Working with the NHANES data</h2>
<p>Throughout this chapter, you will use the NHANES dataset from the NHANES R package. The data are collected by the Center for Disease Control (CDC, the national public health institute in the United States) and can be thought of as a random sample of US residents.</p>
<p>Before moving on to investigate particular variables, you’ll have an opportunity to briefly explore the data in this exercise.</p>

<h2>1-6 Calculating statistic of interest</h2>
<p>Using the NHANES dataset, let’s investigate the relationship between gender and home ownership. Remember, more information about the dataset can be found here:</p>
<p><a href="https://www.rdocumentation.org/packages/NHANES/versions/2.1.0/topics/NHANES" class="uri">https://www.rdocumentation.org/packages/NHANES/versions/2.1.0/topics/NHANES</a></p>
<p>As seen in the video, natural variability can be modeled from shuffling observations around to remove any relationships that might exist in the population. However, before you permute the data, you need to calculate the original observed statistic. In this exercise, you will calculate the difference in proportion of home owners who are men versus women.</p>
<p>Recall that:</p>
<p>%in% returns a logical vector that is TRUE when values on the left hand side are listed on the right hand side.
The mean of a logical vector is the proportion of cases where that vector is TRUE.</p>

<h2>1-7 Randomized data under null model of independence</h2>
<p>The infer package will allow you to model a particular null hypothesis and then randomize the data to calculate permuted statistics. In this exercise, after specifying your null hypothesis you will permute the home ownership variable 10 times. By doing so, you will ensure that there is no relationship between home ownership and gender, so any difference in home ownership proportion for female versus male will be due only to natural variability.</p>
<p>This exercise will demonstrate the first three steps from the infer package:</p>
<p><em>specify</em> will specify the response and explanatory variables.</p>
<p><em>hypothesize</em> will declare the null hypothesis.</p>
<p><em>generate</em> will generate resamples, permutations, or simulations.</p>

<h2>1-8 Randomized statistics and dotplot</h2>
<p>By permuting the home ownership variable multiple times, you generate differences in proportions that are consistent with the assumption that the variables are unrelated. The statistic of interest is the difference in proportions given by stat = “diff in props”. After calculating the randomized statistics, you will plot them in a dotplot.</p>
<p>This exercise shows all four steps from the infer package:</p>
<p>specify will specify the response and explanatory variables.
hypothesize will declare the null hypothesis.
generate will generate resamples, permutations, or simulations.
calculate will calculate summary statistics.
Each step will be covered throughout the course; in this exercise you’ll write code for calculate().</p>
<p>The dplyr, ggplot2, NHANES, and infer packages have been loaded for you. Repeat the permuting and plotting with 100 differences in proportions generated by shuffling the HomeOwn variable.</p>

<h2>2-5 Randomizing gender discrimination</h2>
<p>Recall that we are considering a situation where the number of men and women are fixed (representing the resumes) and the number of people promoted is fixed (the managers were able to promote only 35 individuals).</p>
<p>In this exercise, you’ll create a randomization distribution of the null statistic with 1000 replicates as opposed to just 5 in the previous exercise. As a reminder, the statistic of interest is the difference in proportions promoted between genders (i.e. proportion for males minus proportion for females). From the original dataset, you can calculate how the promotion rates differ between males and females. Using the specify-hypothesis-generate-calculate workflow in infer, you can calculate the same statistic, but instead of getting a single number, you get a whole distribution. In this exercise, you’ll compare that single number from the original dataset to the distribution made by the simulation.</p>

<h2>2-9 Two-sided critical region</h2>
<p>For the discrimination data, the question at hand is whether or not women were promoted less often than men. However, there are often scenarios where the research question centers around a difference without directionality.</p>
<p>For example, you might be interested in whether the rate of promotion for men and women is different. In that case, a difference in proportions of -0.29 is just as “extreme” as a difference of positive 0.29.</p>
<p>If you had seen that women were promoted more often, what would the other side of the distribution of permuted differences look like? That is, what are the smallest (negative) values of the distribution of permuted differences?</p>

<h2>2-12 Sample size in randomization distribution</h2>
<p>We’ve created two new datasets for you with essentially the same difference in proportions as the original discrimination data. However, one of the datasets (disc_small) is one third the size of the original dataset and the other (disc_big) is 10 times larger than the original dataset.</p>
<p>Additionally, the same permutation code used previously has been run on the small and big datasets to create small and big distributions of permuted differences in promotion rates (disc_small_perm and disc_big_perm, respectively).</p>

<p>What if the original research hypothesis had focused on any difference in promotion rates between men and women instead of focusing on whether men are more likely to be promoted than women? In this case, a difference like the one observed would occur twice as often (by chance) because sometimes the difference would be positive and sometimes it would be negative.</p>
