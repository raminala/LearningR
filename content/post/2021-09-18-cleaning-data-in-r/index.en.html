<p>It’s commonly said that data scientists spend 80% of their time cleaning and manipulating data and only 20% of their time analyzing it. The time spent cleaning is vital since analyzing dirty data can lead you to draw inaccurate conclusions.</p>
<p>In this course, you’ll learn how to clean dirty data. Using R, you’ll learn how to identify values that don’t look right and fix dirty data by converting data types, filling in missing values, and using fuzzy string matching. As you learn, you’ll brush up on your skills by working with real-world datasets, including bike-share trips, customer asset portfolios, and restaurant reviews—developing the skills you need to go from raw data to awesome insights as quickly and accurately as possible!</p>

<h2>1-3 Converting data types</h2>
<p>Throughout this chapter, you’ll be working with San Francisco bike share ride data called bike_share_rides. It contains information on start and end stations of each trip, the trip duration, and some user information.</p>
<p>Before beginning to analyze any dataset, it’s important to take a look at the different types of columns you’ll be working with, which you can do using glimpse().</p>
<p>In this exercise, you’ll take a look at the data types contained in bike_share_rides and see how an incorrect data type can flaw your analysis.</p>
<p>dplyr and assertive are loaded and bike_share_rides is available.</p>

<h2>1-4 Trimming strings</h2>
<p>In the previous exercise, you were able to identify the correct data type and convert user_birth_year to the correct type, allowing you to extract counts that gave you a bit more insight into the dataset.</p>
<p>Another common dirty data problem is having extra bits like percent signs or periods in numbers, causing them to be read in as characters. In order to be able to crunch these numbers, the extra bits need to be removed and the numbers need to be converted from character to numeric. In this exercise, you’ll need to convert the duration column from character to numeric, but before this can happen, the word “minutes” needs to be removed from each value.</p>

<h2>1-6 Ride duration constraints</h2>
<p>Values that are out of range can throw off an analysis, so it’s important to catch them early on. In this exercise, you’ll be examining the duration_min column more closely. Bikes are not allowed to be kept out for more than 24 hours, or 1440 minutes at a time, but issues with some of the bikes caused inaccurate recording of the time they were returned.</p>
<p>In this exercise, you’ll replace erroneous data with the range limit (1440 minutes), however, you could just as easily replace these values with NAs.</p>

<h2>1-7 Back to the future</h2>
<p>Something has gone wrong and it looks like you have data with dates from the future, which is way outside of the date range you expected to be working with. To fix this, you’ll need to remove any rides from the dataset that have a date in the future. Before you can do this, the date column needs to be converted from a character to a Date. Having these as Date objects will make it much easier to figure out which rides are from the future, since R makes it easy to check if one Date object is before (&lt;) or after (&gt;) another.</p>

<h2>1-9 Full duplicates</h2>
<p>You’ve been notified that an update has been made to the bike sharing data pipeline to make it more efficient, but that duplicates are more likely to be generated as a result. To make sure that you can continue using the same scripts to run your weekly analyses about ride statistics, you’ll need to ensure that any duplicates in the dataset are removed first.</p>
<p>When multiple rows of a data frame share the same values for all columns, they’re full duplicates of each other. Removing duplicates like this is important, since having the same value repeated multiple times can alter summary statistics like the mean and median. Each ride, including its ride_id should be unique.</p>

<h2>1-10 Removing partial duplicates</h2>
<p>Now that you’ve identified and removed the full duplicates, it’s time to check for partial duplicates. Partial duplicates are a bit tricker to deal with than full duplicates. In this exercise, you’ll first identify any partial duplicates and then practice the most common technique to deal with them, which involves dropping all partial duplicates, keeping only the first.</p>

<div id="aggregating-partial-duplicates" class="section level2">
<h2>1-11 Aggregating partial duplicates</h2>
<p>Another way of handling partial duplicates is to compute a summary statistic of the values that differ between partial duplicates, such as mean, median, maximum, or minimum. This can come in handy when you’re not sure how your data was collected and want an average, or if based on domain knowledge, you’d rather have too high of an estimate than too low of an estimate (or vice versa).</p>
