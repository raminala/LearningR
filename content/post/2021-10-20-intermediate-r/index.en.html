<p>Intermediate R is the next stop on your journey in mastering the R programming language. In this R training, you will learn about conditional statements, loops, and functions to power your own R scripts. Next, make your R code more efficient and readable using the apply functions. Finally, the utilities chapter gets you up to speed with regular expressions in R, data structure manipulations, and times and dates. This course will allow you to take the next step in advancing your overall knowledge and capabilities while programming in R.</p>
<div id="conditionals-and-control-flow" class="section level2">
<h2>1- Conditionals and Control Flow</h2>
<p>In this chapter, you’ll learn about relational operators for comparing R objects, and logical operators like “and” and “or” for combining TRUE and FALSE values. Then, you’ll use this knowledge to build conditional statements.</p>
</div>
<div id="equality" class="section level2">
<h2>1-2 Equality</h2>
<p>The most basic form of comparison is equality. Let’s briefly recap its syntax. The following statements all evaluate to TRUE (feel free to try them out in the console).</p>
<p>3 == (2 + 1)
“intermediate” != “r”
TRUE != FALSE
“Rchitect” != “rchitect”</p>
<p>Notice from the last expression that R is case sensitive: “R” is not equal to “r”. Keep this in mind when solving the exercises in this chapter!</p>
<pre class="r"><code># Comparison of logicals
TRUE == FALSE</code></pre>
<pre><code>## [1] FALSE</code></pre>
<pre class="r"><code># Comparison of numerics
-6 * 14 != 17 - 101</code></pre>
<pre><code>## [1] FALSE</code></pre>
<pre class="r"><code># Comparison of character strings
&quot;useR&quot; == &quot;user&quot;</code></pre>
<pre><code>## [1] FALSE</code></pre>
<pre class="r"><code># Compare a logical with a numeric
TRUE == 1 </code></pre>
<pre><code>## [1] TRUE</code></pre>
</div>
<div id="greater-and-less-than" class="section level2">
<h2>1-3 Greater and less than</h2>
<p>Apart from equality operators, Filip also introduced the less than and greater than operators: &lt; and &gt;. You can also add an equal sign to express less than or equal to or greater than or equal to, respectively. Have a look at the following R expressions, that all evaluate to FALSE:</p>
<p>(1 + 2) &gt; 4
“dog” &lt; “Cats”
TRUE &lt;= FALSE
Remember that for string comparison, R determines the greater than relationship based on alphabetical order. Also, keep in mind that TRUE is treated as 1 for arithmetic, and FALSE is treated as 0. Therefore, FALSE &lt; TRUE is TRUE.</p>
<pre class="r"><code># Comparison of numerics
-6 * 5 + 2 &gt;=  -10 + 1</code></pre>
<pre><code>## [1] FALSE</code></pre>
<pre class="r"><code># Comparison of character strings
&quot;raining&quot; &lt;= &quot;raining dogs&quot;</code></pre>
<pre><code>## [1] TRUE</code></pre>
<pre class="r"><code># Comparison of logicals
TRUE &gt; FALSE</code></pre>
<pre><code>## [1] TRUE</code></pre>
</div>
<div id="compare-vectors" class="section level2">
<h2>1-4 Compare vectors</h2>
<p>You are already aware that R is very good with vectors. Without having to change anything about the syntax, R’s relational operators also work on vectors.</p>
<p>Let’s go back to the example that was started in the video. You want to figure out whether your activity on social media platforms have paid off and decide to look at your results for LinkedIn and Facebook. The sample code in the editor initializes the vectors linkedin and facebook. Each of the vectors contains the number of profile views your LinkedIn and Facebook profiles had over the last seven days.</p>
<p>Using relational operators, find a logical answer, i.e. TRUE or FALSE, for the following questions:</p>
<p>On which days did the number of LinkedIn profile views exceed 15?</p>
<p>When was your LinkedIn profile viewed only 5 times or fewer?</p>
<p>When was your LinkedIn profile visited more often than your Facebook profile?</p>
<pre class="r"><code># The linkedin and facebook vectors have already been created for you
linkedin &lt;- c(16, 9, 13, 5, 2, 17, 14)
facebook &lt;- c(17, 7, 5, 16, 8, 13, 14)

# Popular days
linkedin &gt; 15</code></pre>
<pre><code>## [1]  TRUE FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE  TRUE FALSE</code></pre>
<pre class="r"><code># Quiet days
linkedin &lt;= 5</code></pre>
<pre><code>## [1] FALSE FALSE FALSE  TRUE  TRUE FALSE FALSE</code></pre>
<pre class="r"><code># LinkedIn more popular than Facebook
facebook &lt; linkedin</code></pre>
<pre><code>## [1] FALSE  TRUE  TRUE FALSE FALSE  TRUE FALSE</code></pre>
</div>
<div id="compare-matrices" class="section level2">
<h2>1-5 Compare matrices</h2>
<p>R’s ability to deal with different data structures for comparisons does not stop at vectors. Matrices and relational operators also work together seamlessly!</p>
<p>Instead of in vectors (as in the previous exercise), the LinkedIn and Facebook data is now stored in a matrix called views. The first row contains the LinkedIn information; the second row the Facebook information. The original vectors facebook and linkedin are still available as well.</p>
<p>When were the views exactly equal to 13? Use the views matrix to return a logical matrix.</p>
<p>For which days were the number of views less than or equal to 14? Again, have R return a logical matrix.</p>
<pre class="r"><code># The social data has been created for you
linkedin &lt;- c(16, 9, 13, 5, 2, 17, 14)
facebook &lt;- c(17, 7, 5, 16, 8, 13, 14)
views &lt;- matrix(c(linkedin, facebook), nrow = 2, byrow = TRUE)
views</code></pre>
<pre><code>##      [,1] [,2] [,3] [,4] [,5] [,6] [,7]
## [1,]   16    9   13    5    2   17   14
## [2,]   17    7    5   16    8   13   14</code></pre>
<pre class="r"><code># When does views equal 13?
views == 13</code></pre>
<pre><code>##       [,1]  [,2]  [,3]  [,4]  [,5]  [,6]  [,7]
## [1,] FALSE FALSE  TRUE FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE
## [2,] FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE  TRUE FALSE</code></pre>
<pre class="r"><code># When is views less than or equal to 14?
views &lt;= 14</code></pre>
<pre><code>##       [,1] [,2] [,3]  [,4] [,5]  [,6] [,7]
## [1,] FALSE TRUE TRUE  TRUE TRUE FALSE TRUE
## [2,] FALSE TRUE TRUE FALSE TRUE  TRUE TRUE</code></pre>
</div>
<div id="and" class="section level2">
<h2>1-7 &amp; and |</h2>
<p>Before you work your way through the next exercises, have a look at the following R expressions. All of them will evaluate to TRUE:</p>
<p>TRUE &amp; TRUE
FALSE | TRUE
5 &lt;= 5 &amp; 2 &lt; 3
3 &lt; 4 | 7 &lt; 6
Watch out: 3 &lt; x &lt; 7 to check if x is between 3 and 7 will not work; you’ll need 3 &lt; x &amp; x &lt; 7 for that.</p>
<p>In this exercise, you’ll be working with the last variable. This variable equals the last value of the linkedin vector that you’ve worked with previously. The linkedin vector represents the number of LinkedIn views your profile had in the last seven days, remember? Both the variables linkedin and last have been pre-defined for you.</p>
<pre class="r"><code># The linkedin and last variable are already defined for you
linkedin &lt;- c(16, 9, 13, 5, 2, 17, 14)
last &lt;- tail(linkedin, 1)
last</code></pre>
<pre><code>## [1] 14</code></pre>
<pre class="r"><code># Is last under 5 or above 10?
last &lt; 5 | last &gt; 10</code></pre>
<pre><code>## [1] TRUE</code></pre>
<pre class="r"><code># Is last between 15 (exclusive) and 20 (inclusive)?
15 &lt;last &amp; last &lt;= 20</code></pre>
<pre><code>## [1] FALSE</code></pre>
</div>
<div id="and-2" class="section level2">
<h2>1-8 &amp; and | (2)</h2>
<p>Like relational operators, logical operators work perfectly fine with vectors and matrices.</p>
<p>Both the vectors linkedin and facebook are available again. Also a matrix - views - has been defined; its first and second row correspond to the linkedin and facebook vectors, respectively. Ready for some advanced queries to gain more insights into your social outreach?</p>
<pre class="r"><code># The social data (linkedin, facebook, views) has been created for you

# linkedin exceeds 10 but facebook below 10
linkedin &gt; 10 &amp; facebook &lt; 10</code></pre>
<pre><code>## [1] FALSE FALSE  TRUE FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE</code></pre>
<pre class="r"><code># When were one or both visited at least 12 times?
linkedin &gt;= 12 | facebook &gt;= 12</code></pre>
<pre><code>## [1]  TRUE FALSE  TRUE  TRUE FALSE  TRUE  TRUE</code></pre>
<pre class="r"><code># When is views between 11 (exclusive) and 14 (inclusive)?
views &gt; 11 &amp; views &lt;= 14</code></pre>
<pre><code>##       [,1]  [,2]  [,3]  [,4]  [,5]  [,6] [,7]
## [1,] FALSE FALSE  TRUE FALSE FALSE FALSE TRUE
## [2,] FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE  TRUE TRUE</code></pre>
</div>
<div id="blend-it-all-together" class="section level2">
<h2>1-10 Blend it all together</h2>
<p>With the things you’ve learned by now, you’re able to solve pretty cool problems.</p>
<p>Instead of recording the number of views for your own LinkedIn profile, suppose you conducted a survey inside the company you’re working for. You’ve asked every employee with a LinkedIn profile how many visits their profile has had over the past seven days. You stored the results in a data frame called li_df. This data frame is available in the workspace; type li_df in the console to check it out.</p>
<p>Select the entire second column, named day2, from the li_df data frame as a vector and assign it to second.</p>
<p>Use second to create a logical vector, that contains TRUE if the corresponding number of views is strictly greater than 25 or strictly lower than 5 and FALSE otherwise. Store this logical vector as extremes.
Use sum() on the extremes vector to calculate the number of TRUEs in extremes (i.e. to calculate the number of employees that are either very popular or very low-profile). Simply print this number to the console.</p>
<pre class="r"><code># li_df is pre-loaded in your workspace

# Select the second column, named day2, from li_df: second
second &lt;- li_df$day2

# Build a logical vector, TRUE if value in second is extreme: extremes
extremes &lt;- second &lt; 5 | second &gt; 25 

# Count the number of TRUEs in extremes
sum(extremes==TRUE)</code></pre>
<pre><code>## [1] 16</code></pre>
</div>
<div id="the-if-statement" class="section level2">
<h2>1-12 The if statement</h2>
<p>Before diving into some exercises on the if statement, have another look at its syntax:</p>
<p>if (condition) {
expr
}</p>
<p>Remember your vectors with social profile views? Let’s look at it from another angle. The medium variable gives information about the social website; the num_views variable denotes the actual number of views that particular medium had on the last day of your recordings. Both variables have been pre-defined for you.</p>
<pre class="r"><code># Variables related to your last day of recordings
medium &lt;- &quot;LinkedIn&quot;
num_views &lt;- 14

# Examine the if statement for medium
if (medium == &quot;LinkedIn&quot;) {
  print(&quot;Showing LinkedIn information&quot;)
}</code></pre>
<pre><code>## [1] &quot;Showing LinkedIn information&quot;</code></pre>
<pre class="r"><code># Write the if statement for num_views
if (num_views &gt; 15) {
  print(&quot;You are popular!&quot;)
}</code></pre>
</div>
<div id="add-an-else" class="section level2">
<h2>1-13 Add an else</h2>
<p>You can only use an else statement in combination with an if statement. The else statement does not require a condition; its corresponding code is simply run if all of the preceding conditions in the control structure are FALSE. Here’s a recipe for its usage:</p>
<p>if (condition) {
expr1
} else {
expr2
}</p>
<p>It’s important that the else keyword comes on the same line as the closing bracket of the if part!</p>
<p>Both if statements that you coded in the previous exercises are already available to use. It’s now up to you to extend them with the appropriate else statements!</p>
<pre class="r"><code># Variables related to your last day of recordings
medium &lt;- &quot;LinkedIn&quot;
num_views &lt;- 14

# Control structure for medium
if (medium == &quot;LinkedIn&quot;) {
  print(&quot;Showing LinkedIn information&quot;)
} else {
print(&quot;Unknown medium&quot;)
}</code></pre>
<pre><code>## [1] &quot;Showing LinkedIn information&quot;</code></pre>
<pre class="r"><code># Control structure for num_views
if (num_views &gt; 15) {
  print(&quot;You&#39;re popular!&quot;)
} else {
 print(&quot;Try to be more visible!&quot;)
}</code></pre>
<pre><code>## [1] &quot;Try to be more visible!&quot;</code></pre>
</div>
<div id="customize-further-else-if" class="section level2">
<h2>1-14 Customize further: else if</h2>
<p>The else if statement allows you to further customize your control structure. You can add as many else if statements as you like. Keep in mind that R ignores the remainder of the control structure once a condition has been found that is TRUE and the corresponding expressions have been executed. Here’s an overview of the syntax to freshen your memory:</p>
<p>if (condition1) {
expr1
} else if (condition2) {
expr2
} else if (condition3) {
expr3
} else {
expr4
}
Again, It’s important that the else if keywords comes on the same line as the closing bracket of the previous part of the control construct!</p>
<pre class="r"><code># Variables related to your last day of recordings
medium &lt;- &quot;LinkedIn&quot;
num_views &lt;- 14

# Control structure for medium
if (medium == &quot;LinkedIn&quot;) {
  print(&quot;Showing LinkedIn information&quot;)
} else if (medium == &quot;Facebook&quot;) {
  # Add code to print correct string when condition is TRUE
print(&quot;Showing Facebook information&quot;)
} else {
  print(&quot;Unknown medium&quot;)
}</code></pre>
<pre><code>## [1] &quot;Showing LinkedIn information&quot;</code></pre>
<pre class="r"><code># Control structure for num_views
if (num_views &gt; 15) {
  print(&quot;You&#39;re popular!&quot;)
} else if (num_views &lt;= 15 &amp; num_views &gt; 10) {
  # Add code to print correct string when condition is TRUE
print(&quot;Your number of views is average&quot;)
} else {
  print(&quot;Try to be more visible!&quot;)
}</code></pre>
<pre><code>## [1] &quot;Your number of views is average&quot;</code></pre>
</div>
<div id="take-control" class="section level2">
<h2>1-15 Take control!</h2>
<p>In this exercise, you will combine everything that you’ve learned so far: relational operators, logical operators and control constructs. You’ll need it all!</p>
<p>We’ve pre-defined two values for you: li and fb, denoting the number of profile views your LinkedIn and Facebook profile had on the last day of recordings. Go through the instructions to create R code that generates a ‘social media score’, sms, based on the values of li and fb.</p>
<pre class="r"><code># Variables related to your last day of recordings
li &lt;- 15
fb &lt;- 9

# Code the control-flow construct
if (li &gt;= 15 &amp; fb &gt;= 15) {
  sms &lt;- 2 * (li + fb)
} else if (li &lt; 10 &amp; fb &lt; 10) {
  sms &lt;- 0.5 * (li + fb)
} else {
  sms &lt;- li + fb
}

# Print the resulting sms to the console
sms</code></pre>

<div id="loops" class="section level2">
<h2>2- Loops</h2>
<p>Loops can come in handy on numerous occasions. While loops are like repeated if statements, the for loop is designed to iterate over all elements in a sequence. Learn about them in this chapter.</p>
</div>
<div id="write-a-while-loop" class="section level2">
<h2>2-2 Write a while loop</h2>
<p>Let’s get you started with building a while loop from the ground up. Have another look at its recipe:</p>
<p>while (condition) {
expr
}</p>
<p>Remember that the condition part of this recipe should become FALSE at some point during the execution. Otherwise, the while loop will go on indefinitely.</p>
<p>If your session expires when you run your code, check the body of your while loop carefully.</p>
<p>Have a look at the sample code provided; it initializes the speed variables and already provides a while loop template to get you started.</p>
<pre class="r"><code># Initialize the speed variable
speed &lt;- 64

# Code the while loop
while ( speed&gt; 30 ) {
  print (&quot;Slow down!&quot;)
  speed &lt;- speed-7
}</code></pre>
<pre><code>## [1] &quot;Slow down!&quot;
## [1] &quot;Slow down!&quot;
## [1] &quot;Slow down!&quot;
## [1] &quot;Slow down!&quot;
## [1] &quot;Slow down!&quot;</code></pre>
<pre class="r"><code># Print out the speed variable
speed</code></pre>
<pre><code>## [1] 29</code></pre>
</div>
<div id="throw-in-more-conditionals" class="section level2">
<h2>2-3 Throw in more conditionals</h2>
<p>In the previous exercise, you simulated the interaction between a driver and a driver’s assistant: When the speed was too high, “Slow down!” got printed out to the console, resulting in a decrease of your speed by 7 units.</p>
<p>There are several ways in which you could make your driver’s assistant more advanced. For example, the assistant could give you different messages based on your speed or provide you with a current speed at a given moment.</p>
<p>A while loop similar to the one you’ve coded in the previous exercise is already available for you to use. It prints out your current speed, but there’s no code that decreases the speed variable yet, which is pretty dangerous. Can you make the appropriate changes?</p>
<pre class="r"><code># Initialize the speed variable
speed &lt;- 64

# Extend/adapt the while loop
while (speed &gt; 30) {
  print(paste(&quot;Your speed is&quot;,speed))
  if (speed &gt; 48 ) {
    print(&quot;Slow down big time!&quot;)
    speed &lt;- speed-11
  } else {
    print(&quot;Slow down!&quot;)
    speed &lt;- speed-6
  }

<div id="stop-the-while-loop-break" class="section level2">
<h2>2-4 Stop the while loop: break</h2>
<p>There are some very rare situations in which severe speeding is necessary: what if a hurricane is approaching and you have to get away as quickly as possible? You don’t want the driver’s assistant sending you speeding notifications in that scenario, right?</p>
<p>This seems like a great opportunity to include the break statement in the while loop you’ve been working on. Remember that the break statement is a control statement. When R encounters it, the while loop is abandoned completely.</p>
<pre class="r"><code># Initialize the speed variable
speed &lt;- 88

while (speed &gt; 30) {
  print(paste(&quot;Your speed is&quot;, speed))
  
  # Break the while loop when speed exceeds 80

    break
  }
  
  if (speed &gt; 48) {
    print(&quot;Slow down big time!&quot;)

<h2>2-5 Build a while loop from scratch</h2>

<h2>2-7 Loop over a vector</h2>
<p>In the previous video, Filip told you about two different strategies for using the for loop. To refresh your memory, consider the following loops that are equivalent in R:</p>

<div id="loop-over-a-list" class="section level2">
<h2>2-8 Loop over a list</h2>
<p>Looping over a list is just as easy and convenient as looping over a vector. There are again two different approaches here:</p>

<p>Notice that you need double square brackets - [[ ]] - to select the list elements in loop version 2.</p>
<p>Suppose you have a list of all sorts of information on New York City: its population size, the names of the boroughs, and whether it is the capital of the United States. We’ve already defined a list nyc containing this information (source: Wikipedia).</p>

<div id="loop-over-a-matrix" class="section level2">
<h2>2-9 Loop over a matrix</h2>
<p>In your workspace, there’s a matrix ttt, that represents the status of a tic-tac-toe game. It contains the values “X”, “O” and “NA”. Print out ttt to get a closer look. On row 1 and column 1, there’s “O”, while on row 3 and column 2 there’s “NA”.</p>
<p>To solve this exercise, you’ll need a for loop inside a for loop, often called a nested loop. Doing this in R is a breeze! Simply use the following recipe:</p>
<p>for (var1 in seq1) {
for (var2 in seq2) {
expr
}
}</p>
<p>Finish the nested for loops to go over the elements in ttt:</p>
<p>The outer loop should loop over the rows, with loop index i (use 1:nrow(ttt)).</p>
<p>The inner loop should loop over the columns, with loop index j (use 1:ncol(ttt)).</p>
<p>Inside the inner loop, make use of print() and paste() to print out information in the following format: “On row i and column j the board contains x”, where x is the value on that position.</p>
<pre class="r"><code># The tic-tac-toe matrix ttt has already been defined for you

<p>Let’s return to the LinkedIn profile views data, stored in a vector linkedin. In the first exercise on for loops you already did a simple printout of each element in this vector. A little more in-depth interpretation of this data wouldn’t hurt, right? Time to throw in some conditionals! As with the while loop, you can use the if and else statements inside the for loop.</p>
</div>
<div id="next-you-break-it" class="section level2">
<h2>2-11 Next, you break it</h2>
<p>A possible solution to the previous exercise has been provided for you. The code loops over the linkedin vector and prints out different messages depending on the values of li.</p>
<p>In this exercise, you will use the break and next statements:</p>
<p>The break statement abandons the active loop: the remaining code in the loop is skipped and the loop is not iterated over anymore.
The next statement skips the remainder of the code in the loop, but continues the iteration.</p>

<p>This exercise will not introduce any new concepts on for loops.</p>
<p>We already went ahead and defined a variable rquote. This variable has been split up into a vector that contains separate letters and has been stored in a vector chars with the strsplit() function.</p>
<p>Can you write code that counts the number of r’s that come before the first u in rquote?</p>
